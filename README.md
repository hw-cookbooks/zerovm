zerovm Cookbook
==========================

Install ZeroVM - Cloud Hypervisor. Minimally functional, but will
result in a working `zerovm` bin in your path.

Usage
===============

Include `recipe[zerovm]` in your run_list


Note
==============

ZeroVM is currently very alpha software, so only source based install
is available and that could break at any time.


More info
=================

 - [ZeroVM](http://zerovm.org/wiki/The_Cloud_Hypervisor)
 - [ZeroVM on github](https://github.com/zerovm/)

TODO
==============

 - use `builder` cookbook instead of execute block
 - finish toolchain build
